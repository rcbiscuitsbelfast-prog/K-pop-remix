## Systems Overview

- Player Movement and Animation
  - Status: Implemented. Tile-based steps via `MoveDirector`/`MovePath`; animator parameters (`MoveX`, `MoveY`, `LastMoveX`, `LastMoveY`, `Speed`). Snapping offset supported.
  - Gaps: No pathfinding or NPC avoidance; no slopes; limited run-state handling.
  - Next: Add NPC collision avoidance, queued moves, and configurable movement grid.

- Input System
  - Status: New Input System with message-dispatch to focused target; throttle for holds.
  - Gaps: SendMessage coupling; no rebinding UI; limited multiplayer.
  - Next: Replace SendMessage with interfaces/events; add input rebinding menu.

- Dialog System
  - Status: Pagination via `DialogScroller`; UI transitions and SFX; NPC dialog triggers.
  - Gaps: No branching choices; no localization; no variables/macros in text.
  - Next: Add branching choices, variables (e.g., player name), and CSV/JSON localization.

- Audio (BGM/SFX)
  - Status: Two channels with volume and BGM fade transitions; play-when-idle SFX.
  - Gaps: No mixer groups; no ducking; no playlist/shuffle.
  - Next: Integrate Unity AudioMixer, add ducking and zone-based playlists.

- World/Tilemap
  - Status: Area titles with BGM switch; time-of-day `TileSwapScheduler`.
  - Gaps: No world streaming; limited time/weather effects.
  - Next: Add weather overlays, lighting, and scene streaming hooks.

- Teleport/Warp
  - Status: Portals with fade-out/in, drop-zone and post-drop steps, turn-around delay handling.
  - Gaps: No conditional locks; no cutscene auto-routing.
  - Next: Add conditions (keys/badges), cutscene steps DSL.

- Save/Load State
  - Status: JsonUtility-based save/load with schema versioning; position, direction, area.
  - Gaps: No inventory, party, quests, time-of-day/weather, visited flags.
  - Next: Extend `GameData` for inventory, party, quests; add migration utilities.

- NPCs and Interactions
  - Status: Raycast-based interact layer; dialog trigger; CLI harness simulates dialog + quest flag.
  - Gaps: No pathing NPCs, schedules, or interactions beyond dialog.
  - Next: Add NPC schedules, patrol paths, and simple quest script hooks.

- UI/Transitions
  - Status: Screen fade in/out, message relay to teleporter.
  - Gaps: No pause/menu UI, inventory UI, or settings.
  - Next: Build pause menu (save/load, settings), inventory UI, and map.

- Tooling/Editor
  - Status: Custom drawers for Tag/Layer; hierarchy filter window.
  - Gaps: No quest editor, dialog editor, or tile metadata tools.
  - Next: Create ScriptableObject-based quest and dialog editors.

- Inventory System
  - Status: Core InventoryManager added (singleton, DontDestroyOnLoad), JSON persistence via `GameData.inventory`.
  - Gaps: No in-game UI beyond stub; no item metadata registry; no stacking limits.
  - Next: ScriptableObject ItemDatabase, in-game UI, and item pickup interactions.

- Creatures and Party System
  - Status: v1 core added: `GameData` v6 with creatures and party, `PartyManager`, `SpeciesDatabase`, `CreatureFactory`, `EncounterManager`.
  - Gaps: No battle system; no storage box UI; no move learning/XP.
  - Next: Add storage box, leveling/XP and move learning, and basic battle loop.

- Lore/Codex System
  - Status: v1 core added: `GameData` v7 codex with unlocked list and optional preload entries, `LoreDatabase`, `CodexManager` with unlock/query APIs.
  - Gaps: No in-game UI; no search/filter UI.
  - Next: Build Codex UI, integrate unlocks with quests/encounters and achievements.

- Settings System
  - Status: v1 core added: `GameData` v8 settings (musicVolume, sfxVolume, language, showSubtitles), `SettingsManager` with get/set/apply.
  - Gaps: No in-game UI; no platform sync.
  - Next: Build Settings UI, hook ApplySettings to audio/localization.

- World Enhancements
  - Status: v1 core added: `WorldEnhancementsManager` facade with `OverlayManager`, `LightingManager`, `TimedEventManager`, `ZoneTriggerManager`.
  - Gaps: No in-game bindings to actual overlays/lights yet; sample logging only.
  - Next: Implement real overlay shaders/Canvas, hook timed events to gameplay.

- World Layout and NPC Movement
  - Status: v1 core added: `MapManager` (zones, map load stubs), `NPCMovementManager` (patterns: idle/patrol/follow/flee) with simulation hooks.
  - Gaps: No real navmesh/tile system yet; movement not tied to physics.
  - Next: Integrate with tile-based grid, add AI behavior profiles and collision.

- Combat System
  - Status: v1 core (engine-agnostic) added: combatants, turn manager, actions, damage, victory conditions; hooks for Inventory/AI/Save.
  - Gaps: No full AI profiles, effects/buffs, or animations.
  - Next: Add status effects, AI profiles, and battle UI integration.

- XP/Leveling System
  - Status: v1 core added: `GameData` v10 XP and Levels; `LevelUpManager` loads curve; `XPManager` adds XP and applies level-ups.
  - Gaps: No stat application to creatures; no skill unlock propagation.
  - Next: Apply stat boosts to `CreatureEntry.stats` and integrate with AI/Combat.

## Technical Debt and Fixes

- Fixed: Inventory schema v4 with migration; InventoryManager auto-instantiated.
- Fixed: Dialog schema v5 with migration; Localization and DialogManager added.
- Fixed: Creatures schema v6 with migration; Party/Encounter systems added.
- Fixed: Codex schema v7 with migration; CodexManager and LoreDatabase added.
- Fixed: Settings schema v8 with migration; SettingsManager auto-instantiated.
- Fixed: Editor-only import in `PlayerController.cs` guarded by `#if UNITY_EDITOR`.
- Fixed: Snap/clamp behavior corrected in `MovePath.ClampAxis`.
