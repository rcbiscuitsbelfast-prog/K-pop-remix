# NewBark Unity Engine - Development Roadmap

## Project Overview
NewBark is a retro-style 2D RPG game engine for Unity, inspired by Pok√©mon Gold, Silver, and Crystal. This roadmap outlines the current state and future development priorities.

## Current Status Assessment
Based on the repository analysis, the project has a solid foundation with core systems implemented and is currently in low-maintenance mode. The engine includes basic movement, interaction, audio, and UI systems.

## üèóÔ∏è Section 1: Scaffolding (Core Systems)

### ‚úÖ Completed Core Systems
- **Movement System**: Basic player movement with grid-based movement, running, and animation
- **Input System**: Unity's new Input System integration with controller support
- **Audio System**: Multi-layer audio channel support with area music changes
- **UI Framework**: Basic dialog system and interaction triggers
- **State Management**: Save/load system with player progress
- **Scene Management**: Basic scene transitions and warping system
- **Animation Controller**: Sprite-based animation system
- **Interaction System**: Basic interactable objects and collision detection

### üîß Core Systems Requiring Refactoring
- **Movement System**: 
  - Refactor using editor-assigned properties
  - Implement events like onMoveEnd
  - Better decoupling and move disable/enable functionality
  - Fix MoveTo with warp post movement
  - Handle step-movement disabling during teleportation
- **Warping System**: 
  - Refactor after movement system improvements
  - Fix coordinate issues with moveSteps
  - Improve collision reactivation after movement
- **Dialog System**: 
  - Fix text ordering issues
  - Improve button response handling
  - Better dialog trigger management

### üöß Core Systems Needing Completion
- **Screen Fader**: Basic implementation exists but needs improvement
- **Area Title System**: Scriptable object-based system implemented
- **Tilemap System**: Day/night cycle support and tile swapping
- **Camera System**: Bounds and following mechanics
- **Physics System**: 2D collision and trigger optimization
